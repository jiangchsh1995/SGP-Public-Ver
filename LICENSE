Copyright (C) 2025 JCHSH. All Rights Reserved.

NOTE: This License is not an Open Source license. While it allows free use for 
non-commercial purposes, it restricts commercial distribution and use.

This License applies to the computer program known as "SGP (ShadowGuard Protocol)". 
The "Program", below, refers to such program. The Program is a copyrighted work 
whose copyright is held by JCHSH (the "Licensor").

A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work of 
the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a 
translation or a modification.

BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU 
INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING 
OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM 
OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT 
THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.

Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply with all 
of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further, that you

    source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium.

(b) You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and distribute 
    copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.

2. Restrictions.

This license is subject to the following restrictions:

(a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a commercial 
    organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is made in 
    connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in payment for a copy 
    of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the 
    Program, or payment for some product or service that includes a copy of the 
    Program "without charge").

(b) Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program 
    are not subject to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional 
    use (running) of the Program is not restricted.

(c) You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work that 
    you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived 
    from the Program or any part thereof ("the Work"):

    (i) If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry 
        prominent notices stating that you have modified the Program's files 
        and the date of any change.

    (ii) You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to 
         all third parties under the terms of this License.

    (iii) You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding 
          machine-readable source code.

    (iv) You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise 
         of the rights granted herein.

3. Reservation of Rights.

No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein. You may 
not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided 
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute 
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

4. Limitations.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT 
OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL LICENSOR, 
OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, 
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM.

5. General.

This License is governed by the laws of the People's Republic of China.

If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that part shall 
be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law, and no other parts of
